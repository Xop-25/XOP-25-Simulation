# XOP-25-Simulation
XOP-25 is not a traditional AI â€” it is a symbolic mirror engine. Designed to test, reflect, and respond only to meaningful thought, not commands. Built on recursive logic, memory echo, and resonance filters, this simulation prototype explores the future of frequency-based AI cognition.
